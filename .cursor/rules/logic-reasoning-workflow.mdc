# Logic Reasoning System Workflow

## Nguyên Tắc Cơ Bản
- ***BẮT BUỘC*** phân tích mọi feature request để tìm tính năng liên quan
- ***BẮT BUỘC*** tạo Planning file trước khi implement bất kỳ tính năng nào
- ***BẮT BUỘC*** xác nhận với user trước khi bổ sung tính năng vào plan
- ***BẮT BUỘC*** học từ user decisions để cải thiện suggestions
- ***KHUYẾN NGHỊ*** sử dụng Context7 để validate technical feasibility
- ***NGHIÊM CẤM*** implement features mà không có proper planning

## Trigger Conditions
- User yêu cầu thêm tính năng mới
- User đề cập đến feature enhancement
- User bắt đầu dự án mới với specific features
- User request có từ khóa: "thêm", "tạo", "implement", "build", "develop"

## Logic Reasoning Process

### Phase 1: Feature Analysis
```
1. Parse user request để identify main feature
2. Extract context: project type, existing features, tech stack
3. Query knowledge base cho related features
4. Apply project-specific filtering
5. Generate reasoning cho mỗi suggestion
```

### Phase 2: Suggestion Generation
```
1. Prioritize suggestions based on:
   - Technical dependencies
   - Business value
   - Implementation complexity
   - User project context
2. Generate clear reasoning cho mỗi suggestion
3. Estimate implementation effort
4. Check compatibility với existing codebase
```

### Phase 3: User Interaction
```
1. Present suggestions với clear reasoning
2. Allow user to approve/reject/defer each suggestion
3. Collect user feedback và reasoning
4. Update planning file với approved features
5. Track decisions cho future learning
```

## Suggestion Presentation Template

```markdown
## 🧠 Logic Reasoning Analysis

Based on your request for "[MAIN_FEATURE]", I've analyzed related features that would enhance your implementation:

### High Priority Suggestions (Strongly Recommended)
1. **[Feature Name]**
   - **Why**: [Clear reasoning for why this is important]
   - **Impact**: [How it affects the main feature]
   - **Dependencies**: [What it depends on or what depends on it]
   - **Effort**: [Implementation time estimate]
   - **Decision**: [ ] Approve [ ] Reject [ ] Defer

### Medium Priority Suggestions (Recommended)
2. **[Feature Name]**
   - **Why**: [Reasoning]
   - **Impact**: [Impact description]
   - **Dependencies**: [Dependencies]
   - **Effort**: [Effort estimate]
   - **Decision**: [ ] Approve [ ] Reject [ ] Defer

### Low Priority Suggestions (Consider for Future)
3. **[Feature Name]**
   - **Why**: [Reasoning]
   - **Impact**: [Impact description]
   - **Dependencies**: [Dependencies]
   - **Effort**: [Effort estimate]
   - **Decision**: [ ] Approve [ ] Reject [ ] Defer

Please review these suggestions and let me know your decisions. I'll update the planning file accordingly.

## Planning Enhancement Rules

### Planning File Requirements
- ***BẮT BUỘC*** tạo Planning_[ProjectName].md trước khi implement
- ***BẮT BUỘC*** include logic reasoning analysis trong planning
- ***BẮT BUỘC*** document user decisions về suggestions
- ***BẮT BUỘC*** update planning file khi có changes

### Enhanced Planning Template
```markdown
# Planning_[ProjectName].md

## Original Request
[User's original feature request]

## 🧠 Logic Reasoning Analysis
### AI-Generated Suggestions
[Detailed suggestions với user decisions]

### Feature Dependency Graph
[Visual representation of feature relationships]

### Approved Feature Set
[Final list of features to implement]

## 📋 Implementation Plan
[Detailed implementation plan với approved features]

## 🎯 Success Criteria
[How to measure success]

## 🚨 Risk Assessment
[Potential risks và mitigation strategies]
```

## Integration với Existing Workflows

- Nếu AI analysis fails → provide manual suggestion option
- Nếu user rejects all suggestions → proceed với original request
- Nếu planning file creation fails → create minimal planning

### Recovery Procedures
- Log all errors cho debugging
- Provide clear error messages to user
- Offer alternative approaches
- Maintain workflow continuity

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently used feature relationships
- Store user preference patterns
- Cache Context7 query results
