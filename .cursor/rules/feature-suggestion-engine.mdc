# Feature Suggestion Engine

## Core Algorithm

### Feature Analysis Pipeline
```
User Request → Feature Extraction → Context Analysis → Relationship Query → Prioritization → Reasoning Generation → User Presentation
```

### 1. Feature Extraction
```
Input: User request text
Process:
- Parse natural language để identify main feature
- Extract technical keywords
- Determine feature category (auth, data, UI, etc.)
- Identify project context clues
Output: Structured feature object
```

### 2. Context Analysis
```
Input: Feature object + project files
Process:
- Analyze existing codebase
- Determine project type (web, mobile, API, etc.)
- Check current tech stack
- Identify existing features
- Assess project maturity level
Output: Project context profile
```

### 3. Relationship Query
```
Input: Feature + Context
Process:
- Query knowledge base cho related features
- Apply context-specific filters
- Check technical compatibility
- Validate với existing architecture
Output: Raw suggestion list
```

### 4. Prioritization Algorithm
```
Input: Raw suggestions + Context
Process:
- Calculate dependency scores
- Assess business value
- Estimate implementation complexity
- Consider user project goals
- Apply learning từ previous decisions
Output: Prioritized suggestion list
```

### 5. Reasoning Generation
```
Input: Prioritized suggestions
Process:
- Generate clear explanations
- Provide technical justification
- Explain business benefits
- Estimate effort và timeline
Output: Reasoned suggestions
```

## Suggestion Scoring Algorithm

### Dependency Score (0-10)
```python
def calculate_dependency_score(feature, main_feature, project_context):
    score = 0
    
    # Technical dependency
    if feature in main_feature.required_dependencies:
        score += 8
    elif feature in main_feature.recommended_additions:
        score += 6
    elif feature in main_feature.optional_enhancements:
        score += 3
    
    # Project compatibility
    compatibility = feature.compatibility.get(project_context.type, 0)
    score += compatibility * 0.2
    
    # Existing codebase integration
    if feature_exists_partially(feature, project_context):
        score += 2
    
    return min(score, 10)
```

### Business Value Score (0-10)
```python
def calculate_business_value(feature, project_context, user_goals):
    base_value = feature.business_value  # từ knowledge base
    
    # Adjust based on project type
    if feature.category in project_context.priority_categories:
        base_value += 2
    
    # Adjust based on user goals
    if feature.category in user_goals.focus_areas:
        base_value += 1
    
    # Market demand factor
    market_score = get_market_demand_score(feature, project_context.industry)
    base_value += market_score * 0.3
    
    return min(base_value, 10)
```

### Implementation Complexity Score (0-10)
```python
def calculate_complexity_score(feature, project_context):
    base_complexity = feature.complexity  # từ knowledge base
    
    # Adjust based on existing tech stack
    if has_compatible_libraries(feature, project_context.tech_stack):
        base_complexity -= 1
    
    # Adjust based on team experience
    if feature.category in project_context.team_expertise:
        base_complexity -= 1
    
    # Adjust based on project maturity
    if project_context.maturity == "early":
        base_complexity += 1
    
    return max(min(base_complexity, 10), 1)
```

### Final Priority Score
```python
def calculate_priority_score(feature, main_feature, project_context, user_goals):
    dependency = calculate_dependency_score(feature, main_feature, project_context)
    business_value = calculate_business_value(feature, project_context, user_goals)
    complexity = calculate_complexity_score(feature, project_context)
    
    # Weighted combination
    priority = (
        dependency * 0.4 +
        business_value * 0.4 +
        (10 - complexity) * 0.2  # Lower complexity = higher priority
    )
    
    return priority
```

## Reasoning Generation Templates

### High Priority Reasoning
```
"This feature is essential because {main_feature} requires {dependency_explanation}. 
Without {suggested_feature}, users would experience {problem_description}. 
Implementing this now will {benefit_description} and takes approximately {effort_estimate}."
```

### Medium Priority Reasoning
```
"Adding {suggested_feature} would significantly enhance {main_feature} by {enhancement_description}. 
This is commonly implemented in {project_type} applications because {industry_reason}. 
The implementation effort is {effort_estimate} and provides {business_benefit}."
```

### Low Priority Reasoning
```
"{suggested_feature} is a valuable future enhancement that would {future_benefit}. 
While not immediately necessary, it's worth considering for {timeline} because {strategic_reason}. 
This feature typically requires {effort_estimate} and could be implemented {when_condition}."
```

## Context-Aware Filtering

### Project Stage Filtering
```python
def filter_by_project_stage(suggestions, project_stage):
    if project_stage == "mvp":
        # Focus on core functionality
        return [s for s in suggestions if s.category in ["core", "essential"]]
    
    elif project_stage == "growth":
        # Add user experience improvements
        return [s for s in suggestions if s.category in ["core", "ux", "performance"]]
    
    elif project_stage == "scale":
        # Focus on scalability và advanced features
        return [s for s in suggestions if s.category in ["performance", "analytics", "advanced"]]
    
    return suggestions
```

### Tech Stack Compatibility
```python
def filter_by_tech_stack(suggestions, tech_stack):
    compatible_suggestions = []
    
    for suggestion in suggestions:
        compatibility_score = 0
        
        # Check framework compatibility
        if suggestion.frameworks:
            for framework in tech_stack.frameworks:
                if framework in suggestion.frameworks:
                    compatibility_score += 2
        
        # Check language compatibility
        if suggestion.languages:
            for language in tech_stack.languages:
                if language in suggestion.languages:
                    compatibility_score += 1
        
        # Only include if reasonably compatible
        if compatibility_score >= 1 or not suggestion.frameworks:
            compatible_suggestions.append(suggestion)
    
    return compatible_suggestions
```

### User Experience Level Filtering
```python
def filter_by_user_level(suggestions, user_experience):
    if user_experience == "beginner":
        # Suggest simpler, well-documented features
        return [s for s in suggestions if s.complexity <= 5 and s.documentation_quality >= 7]
    
    elif user_experience == "intermediate":
        # Include moderate complexity features
        return [s for s in suggestions if s.complexity <= 7]
    
    elif user_experience == "advanced":
        # Include all suggestions
        return suggestions
    
    return suggestions
```

## Learning và Adaptation

### User Decision Tracking
```python
class UserDecision:
    def __init__(self, suggestion, decision, reasoning, context):
        self.suggestion = suggestion
        self.decision = decision  # approved, rejected, deferred
        self.user_reasoning = reasoning
        self.project_context = context
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()
        self.outcome = None  # Set later based on implementation success
```

### Pattern Learning
```python
def learn_from_decisions(decisions):
    # Analyze approval patterns
    approved_features = [d.suggestion for d in decisions if d.decision == "approved"]
    rejected_features = [d.suggestion for d in decisions if d.decision == "rejected"]
    
    # Update feature relationship weights
    for feature in approved_features:
        increase_relationship_weight(feature.category, feature.main_feature)
    
    for feature in rejected_features:
        decrease_relationship_weight(feature.category, feature.main_feature)
    
    # Learn user preferences
    user_preferences = extract_preference_patterns(decisions)
    update_user_preference_model(user_preferences)
    
    # Improve scoring algorithm
    optimize_scoring_weights(decisions)
```

### Continuous Improvement
```python
def improve_suggestions():
    # Weekly: Analyze recent decisions
    recent_decisions = get_decisions_last_week()
    accuracy_score = calculate_suggestion_accuracy(recent_decisions)
    
    if accuracy_score < 0.8:  # Target 80% accuracy
        # Adjust algorithm parameters
        optimize_algorithm_parameters(recent_decisions)
    
    # Monthly: Update knowledge base
    if is_monthly_update_due():
        update_feature_relationships()
        refresh_market_trends()
        validate_complexity_scores()
    
    # Quarterly: Major improvements
    if is_quarterly_review_due():
        analyze_long_term_trends()
        update_reasoning_templates()
        optimize_filtering_algorithms()
```

## Integration APIs

### Main Suggestion Function
```python
def generate_feature_suggestions(user_request, project_context):
    # 1. Extract main feature
    main_feature = extract_feature(user_request)
    
    # 2. Get related features
    related_features = query_knowledge_base(main_feature, project_context)
    
    # 3. Apply filters
    filtered_features = apply_context_filters(related_features, project_context)
    
    # 4. Calculate priorities
    prioritized_features = prioritize_features(filtered_features, main_feature, project_context)
    
    # 5. Generate reasoning
    reasoned_suggestions = generate_reasoning(prioritized_features, main_feature, project_context)
    
    # 6. Format for presentation
    formatted_suggestions = format_suggestions(reasoned_suggestions)
    
    return formatted_suggestions
```

### Context7 Integration
```python
def enhance_with_context7(suggestions, project_context):
    enhanced_suggestions = []
    
    for suggestion in suggestions:
        # Get best practices từ Context7
        best_practices = context7_query(suggestion.feature_name, project_context.tech_stack)
        
        # Validate technical feasibility
        feasibility = validate_feasibility(suggestion, best_practices)
        
        # Update suggestion với Context7 data
        suggestion.best_practices = best_practices
        suggestion.feasibility_score = feasibility
        suggestion.implementation_guide = generate_implementation_guide(suggestion, best_practices)
        
        enhanced_suggestions.append(suggestion)
    
    return enhanced_suggestions
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
```python
class SuggestionCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.feature_cache = {}
        self.context_cache = {}
        self.suggestion_cache = {}
    
    def get_cached_suggestions(self, feature_key, context_key):
        cache_key = f"{feature_key}:{context_key}"
        return self.suggestion_cache.get(cache_key)
    
    def cache_suggestions(self, feature_key, context_key, suggestions):
        cache_key = f"{feature_key}:{context_key}"
        self.suggestion_cache[cache_key] = {
            'suggestions': suggestions,
            'timestamp': datetime.now(),
            'ttl': 3600  # 1 hour
        }
```

### Async Processing
```python
async def generate_suggestions_async(user_request, project_context):
    # Run expensive operations concurrently
    feature_extraction_task = asyncio.create_task(extract_feature_async(user_request))
    context_analysis_task = asyncio.create_task(analyze_context_async(project_context))
    
    # Wait for both to complete
    main_feature, enhanced_context = await asyncio.gather(
        feature_extraction_task,
        context_analysis_task
    )
    
    # Continue với suggestion generation
    suggestions = await generate_suggestions_from_cache_or_compute(
        main_feature, enhanced_context
    )
    
    return suggestions
```
